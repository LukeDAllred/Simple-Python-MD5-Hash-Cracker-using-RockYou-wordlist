Simple MD5 Hash Cracker in python using the hash library.

How to use:
1. Make sure both the "Hash_Cracker.py" and "Rockyou.txt" files are in the same directory or change the path to wherever your wordlist is stored.
2. Open a Terminal in the directory where your Hash Cracker script is located and run the following command: "py Hash_Cracker.py"
3. Once prompted for an input, put in your Unsalted MD5 hash in and press enter.
   (*NOTE*, it could take some time for the Hash to be cracked. ALSO, if the plaintext of the hash isn't in the rockyou wordlist it will NOT be able to crack it).
